# GB Studio 4.1 - Plugin Pak

A set of experimental plugins for GB Studio 4.1. Use them at your own risk :)

> [!NOTE] 
> A handful of previously available event plugins are now deprecated as their functionlity is part of GB Studio. [See the list below](#deprecated-plugins).

## Dialogue & Menus

### Draw Lifebar

Draw a (life/power/mana)bar to a specified position on the overlay.
- `X`, `Y`: Tile coordinates on the overlay.
- `Tileset`: A tileset that includes the tiles for the bar in consecutive order.
- `Tile`: The first tile of the bar in the tileset (usually the empty tile).
- `Value`: The current value to be represented by the bar.
- `Max Value`: The maximum value that can be represented by the bar.
- `Steps`: The number of tiles needed to "fill" an item in the bar (not including the empty one).

[Example project](examples/Draw%20Lifebar/)

_Note:_ The tileset will load in tile 128 of VRAM (right after the sprites block). This allows combining the lifebar rendering with using `Draw Text` on the overlay. The VRAM index can be changed by editing the `const VRAM_BASE_START_TILE = 128` line in the plugin file.

### Display Advanced Menu

Display a menu of multiple options and set the specified variable to the value of the chosen option.

Menu option position and navigation order can be set for each item in the `Items` tab. The dialogue box size and the opening and closing direction can be set in the `Layout` tab.

There's no maximum character length per item, but the total amount of displayed characters is limited to by the number of tiles reserved for UI text (52 for non-color mode).

_Note:_ The event can get very long when there's a lot of items.

## Real Time Clock

A set of events that give access to the Real Time Clock functionality present in some GB cartridges.

_Note:_ Cartridge type needs to be set to `MBC3` in the project Settings, for RTC to work.

### Set Clock Time

Set the values of the real time clock fields with a number or the value of a variable.

### Store Clock Time In Variables

Store the current time in one variable for each value.

### Start Clock

Starts the real time clock.

### Stop Clock

Stops the real time clock.

## Screen

### Smooth Fade

**Color Mode Only**

Fade some or all of the current scene's background or sprites palettes to or from a white or black screen, interpolating the color values for a smooth fade.

## Î² Plugins

The plugins in this category are even more experimental than the ones above and might change in the future.

- **Move Variable Actor To** and **Store Variable Actor Position In Variables**:
  - These events duplicate existing GB Studio Actor events but instead of using a dropdown to select the actor they use a variable. The value of the variable represents the index of the actor in the scene (the player is always `0` and the rest of the actors have an index assigned based on when they were added to the scene).
- **Pin Actor to Screen** and **Unpin Actor from Screen**:
  - Pin or Unpin the actor to its current screen coordinates. Be aware of the current state of the actor: If it's already pinned or unpinned when the event is called its position will be wrongly offset based on the scroll position.

## How to Install

Drop the `plugins` folder in your project. All the above events will be available from the `Add Event` button.
